<h1 align='left'>Project Background</h1>
The company tracks sales performance by comparing actual sales against targets for each salesperson across different teams (Delish, Yummies, Juices, Tempo). 
The dashboard shows overall sales numbers, monthly trends, and individual performance. 
It helps managers see who is meeting goals, who is falling short, and how sales are trending over time.

<h3 align='left'>PROJECT METRICS</h3>

<p>Insights and recommendation are provided on the following Key areas:
  
<br><b>Overall Sales:</b> Total sales reached about $18.95M compared to a target of $19.32M, showing a small gap (about 1.9% below target).
<br><b>Monthly Trends:</b> Out of 14 months, only 2 months met or exceeded the sales target. Most months were slightly below target, with a noticeable decline starting late 2023.
<br><b>Individual Performance:</b> Some salespeople (like Kaine Padly and Barr Faughny) exceeded their targets, while others (like Camilla Castle and Marney O’Breen) consistently fell short.
<br><b>Team Insights:</b> Each team has mixed results — some members are strong performers, while others need support to close the gap.
<br><b>Recent Trend:</b> Sales started dropping in November 2023, with actual sales falling by nearly 25%, which signals a need for corrective action.</p>


<h3 align='left'>DATA STRUCTURE and INITIAL CHECKS</h3>
The dataset is organized into four parts: one table shows each salesperson’s actual monthly sales, another shows their monthly sales targets, a calendar table lists the dates for alignment, and a people table links each salesperson to their team and profile info. 
Together, these tables let you compare actual vs. target sales over time and analyze performance by individual or team.

<h1 align='left'>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h1>
<p>The sales dashboard shows that overall performance is close to target, with $18.95M actual sales versus $19.32M target (a 1.9% gap). 
  However, only 2 out of 14 months met or exceeded targets, and a clear downward trend began in late 2023, with sales dropping nearly 25% by November.

At the individual level, some salespeople such as Kaine Padly and Barr Faughny consistently exceeded their targets, while others like Camilla Castle and 
Marney O’Breen fell short by significant margins. Team performance is mixed, with strong contributors offset by weaker results.

This data suggests that while the company is broadly aligned with its sales goals, sustained growth will require targeted support for underperforming individuals 
and corrective action to reverse the recent decline. Focusing on high performers’ strategies, strengthening coaching for weaker performers, 
and addressing seasonal dips will help close the gap and stabilize results moving forward.</p>

<h1 align='left'>SALES TREND</h1>
<p><br><b>Overall Performance:</b> Across 14 months (Jan 2023 – Feb 2024), actual sales are close to targets but consistently fall short. Only a few months (like May 2023, Nov 2023, and Jan–Mar 2024) show actual sales slightly above target.
<br><b>Start of 2023:</b> Sales were mostly below target, with uneven performance across teams and several individuals struggling to meet expectations.
<br<b>>Middle of 2023:</b> Sales improved in May and August, with strong contributions from top performers like Barr Faughny and Dennison Crosswaite helping actuals exceed targets.
<br><b>Late 2023 to Early 2024:</b> Sales dropped sharply in November (about 24% decline), but rebounded slightly in January and February 2024, showing recovery though still fragile.</p>
